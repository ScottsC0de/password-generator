# password-generator
A random password generator powered by JavaScript

## Description
This webpage was created to demonstrate how JavaScript can manipulate and add interactivity to a HTML. An of example of generating a random password was used. Using Web APIs, JavaScript was able to grab a button from my HTML file and perform a function when the user clicks the button. Within this function, prompts are sent to the user's screen asking for input. The input boxes ask how many characters the user would like in their password, and if they'd like to include uppercase, lowercase, number, and/or symbol values. Once everything is selected, JavaScript is able to have the output of the function be displayed as text on the page. This was an excellent example of how JavaScript powers a webpage.

## User
Upon clicking the link to the webpage (see "Links" below), the user will be directed a single webpage. Here, the user will see a Password Generator, with a text placeholder and a button. The placeholder tells the user to click the button. Once the button is clicked, answer the oncoming prompts to fill your random password criteria. You are allowed to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols. You must choose at least one. Failure to comply with any prompt results in the program terminating. The user can then restart by pressing the button again.
